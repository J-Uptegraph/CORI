## 🚀 Next Phase: Physical-Virtual Integration Pipeline

### 1. **Virtual Object Correlation** 🎯 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**
- [ ] **Physical-Virtual Matching:** Real camera detects red object → CORI searches virtual world for matching red objects
- [ ] **Virtual Camera CV Integration:** Connect CORI's head camera to existing OpenCV pipeline
- [ ] **Dual-Camera Processing:** Simultaneous physical + virtual camera analysis
- [ ] **Object Correspondence:** Link real-world detections to virtual counterparts

### 2. **Gripper Joint Control** 🤖 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- [ ] **Hand/Gripper Joints:** Add controllable finger segments for grasping
- [ ] **Pick Sequence Programming:** Coordinated arm + gripper movement
- [ ] **Grip Force Control:** Secure object handling with force feedback
- [ ] **Safety Constraints:** Joint limits and collision avoidance

### 3. **Locomotion & Navigation** 🚶 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- [ ] **Leg Joint Articulation:** Convert static legs to controllable hip/knee/ankle joints
- [ ] **Balance Control:** Dynamic stability during movement and object carrying
- [ ] **Path Planning:** Navigation from object to appropriate hamper
- [ ] **Load Compensation:** Gait adjustment when carrying objects

### 4. **Complete Sorting Workflow** 📦 **INTEGRATION TARGET**
- [ ] **End-to-End Pipeline:** Physical detection → Virtual search → Pickup → Delivery
- [ ] **Multi-Object Management:** Handle multiple detected objects simultaneously
- [ ] **Error Recovery:** Fallback behaviors for failed operations
- [ ] **Performance Optimization:** Minimize sorting cycle completion time

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Enhanced Tech Stack:** ROS 2 Humble | Gazebo Ignition | OpenCV | Blender | Joint Controllers | Python

**New System Components:**
- Individual mesh exports with proper joint origins
- Joint position controllers with PID tuning
- Color detection event processing with movement commands
- Search behavior state machine with object tracking logic

🎯 **Next Milestone:** Transform CORI from object detection to complete autonomous sorting - where physical camera detection triggers virtual world search, object pickup, and delivery to the correct hamper.

## 💫 The Vision: Physical-to-Virtual Task Execution

**Complete Autonomous Sorting Pipeline:**
1. **Physical Detection** → Real camera identifies colored clothing
2. **Virtual Search** → CORI's head camera finds matching virtual objects  
3. **Autonomous Pickup** → Gripper executes precise grasping
4. **Intelligent Delivery** → Locomotion carries objects to correct hampers

CORI is evolving from demonstration platform to functional robotic worker capable of real-world task execution.
