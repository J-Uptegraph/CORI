# 📢 CORI Update – v1.3

Date: June 19, 2025

🎉 **MVP ACHIEVED!** CORI now has a **complete real-time color detection and classification system** with robust ROS 2 integration and Gazebo simulation. The system successfully demonstrates automated laundry sorting logic through live color detection, providing the foundation for physical robot control integration.

**System Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL  
**Integration Level:** Real-world Detection & Classification Complete

## ✅ Major Achievements

### 🎯 Complete System Integration
- ✅ **Real-time color detection pipeline:** Webcam → OpenCV → ROS 2 → Terminal display
- ✅ **Simultaneous Gazebo simulation:** CORI robot in custom laundry world
- ✅ **Live classification system:** Objects sorted into LIGHTS/DARKS/COLORS piles
- ✅ **Process orchestration:** All systems running concurrently with proper timing

### 🛠️ Robust Build System
- ✅ **Master build script (`build.bash`):** 5-option menu system
 - 🚀 Full system (Gazebo + Webcam + Color Detection)
 - 🎮 Gazebo simulation only
 - 📷 Webcam detection only
 - 🧹 Smart cleanup with camera reset
 - 🚪 Clean exit
- ✅ **Automated process management:** Background process handling with health checks
- ✅ **Intelligent startup sequencing:** Staged launch with proper timing delays

### 🔧 Advanced Problem Solving
- ✅ **USB camera driver management:** Automated `modprobe` reset (simulates unplug/replug)
- ✅ **Process cleanup system:** Comprehensive ROS/Gazebo process termination
- ✅ **Resource conflict resolution:** Camera lock prevention and recovery
- ✅ **Standalone cleanup utility:** `kill_all.bash` for emergency reset

### 👁️ Computer Vision Excellence
- ✅ **HSV color space processing:** Robust color detection under varying lighting
- ✅ **Multi-color classification:** 12+ colors mapped to laundry categories
- ✅ **Real-time terminal display:** Live color feedback with pile assignments
- ✅ **ROS 2 message integration:** `/cori/color_detected` topic publishing

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Tech Stack:** ROS 2 Humble | Gazebo Ignition | OpenCV | v4l2_camera | Python | URDF/SDF | Colcon

🎯 **Next Steps:** Clean up the interface and improve detection reliability for better user experience.

## 🚀 Immediate Improvements

### 1. **Clean Up Terminal Output**
- [ ] Remove duplicate messages
- [ ] Single clean display instead of multiple windows
- [ ] Better formatting for easier reading

### 2. **Make Color Detection More Stable**
- [ ] Add "hold time" - color must be detected for 2-3 seconds before changing
- [ ] Improve confidence thresholds to reduce false detections
- [ ] Stop rapid color switching that's confusing to watch
- [ ] Add more color variations for better recognition

### 3. **Move Display to Gazebo Window**
- [ ] Show color detection results inside Gazebo instead of separate terminal
- [ ] Unified interface - everything in one place
- [ ] Add simple controls (start/stop buttons)

---

## 🎯 Future Goals

### 4. **Virtual Camera Integration**
- [ ] Add virtual camera to CORI robot in Gazebo
- [ ] Run same color detection on virtual objects
- [ ] Connect real world detection to virtual world

### 5. **Autonomous Sorting (Stretch Goal)**
- [ ] When real camera detects red → robot finds red object in virtual world
- [ ] Robot picks up the virtual object
- [ ] Robot sorts it into correct bin

## 💡 Why These Changes Matter

**After Improvements:**
- Clean, simple interface
- Stable, reliable color detection
- Professional-looking system

---

🎯 **Goal:** Make CORI easier to use and more reliable for demonstrations and development as I look towards the future.
