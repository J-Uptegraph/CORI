# CORI Update â€“ v1.0 (June 9, 2025)

Finished the first version of **CORI's laundry color detection system**.

## Features

- **Live webcam feed processing** at approximately 30 FPS
- **Individual clothing item detection** in real-time
- **Color classification system** with three categories:
  - LIGHTS (e.g., white)
  - DARKS (e.g., black)
  - COLORS (e.g., red, blue, green)
- **Real-time bounding boxes** drawn in each item's assigned color
- **Live summary display** in the top-right corner showing:
  - Total detected items
  - Count per color category

## Technology Stack

Built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **ROS 2**.

## Next Steps

- Enable scanning only when a new bin is presented or an item is picked
- **Long-term plan:** Migrate to palm-mounted cameras for grasp-time scanning

## Future Considerations

> Considering a future shift to Moondream for advanced clothing-type detection and low-level logic.

Progress is steady and functional.
