### ðŸ“¢ CORI Update â€“ v1.0 (June 9, 2025)

Finished the first version of **CORIâ€™s laundry color detection system**:

- Reads live webcam feed at approximately **30 FPS**  
- Detects individual clothing items in-frame  
- Classifies each item by color:  
  - LIGHTS (e.g., white)  
  - DARKS (e.g., black)  
  - COLORS (e.g., red, blue, green)  
- Draws real-time bounding boxes in the item's assigned color  
- Displays a live summary in the top-right showing:  
  - Total detected items  
  - Count per color category

Built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **ROS 2**.

---

**Next Steps:**  
Enable scanning only when a new bin is presented or an item is picked.  
Long-term plan: migrate to palm-mounted cameras for grasp-time scanning.

Progress is steady and functional.

> Considering a future shift to Moondream for advanced clothing-type detection and low-level logic.
