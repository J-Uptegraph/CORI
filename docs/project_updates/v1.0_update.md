Finished the first version of **CORIâ€™s laundry color detection system**:

- Reads live webcam feed at ~60 FPS  
- Detects clothing items in-frame  
- Classifies by color:  
  - LIGHTS (e.g., white)  
  - DARKS (e.g., black)  
  - COLORS (e.g., red, blue, green)  
- Draws bounding boxes using the assigned color  
- Displays a live summary in the top-right showing:  
  - Total items  
  - Count per category

Built in Python with OpenCV and ROS 2.

**Next steps:** Enable scanning only when a new bin is presented or an item is picked. Vision is currently sourced from a basic webcam, but the long-term plan is for CORI to scan items using palm-mounted cameras before grasping.

Progress is solid. ðŸ“ˆ  

> Considering a shift to Moondream for advanced clothing-type detection and low-level logic.
