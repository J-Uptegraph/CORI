**ðŸ“¢CORI Update â€“ v1.1 (June 11, 2025)**

Established a stable GUI overlay system for CORIâ€™s vision pipeline, including accurate bounding box drawing and frame categorization.

- GUI added with real-time color-coded bounding boxes  
- Validated performance in a blacked-out room at a stable **30 FPS**  
- Bounding boxes accurately match detected color classifications:
  - LIGHTS  
  - DARKS  
  - COLORS  
- Visual overlays confirmed to be spatially consistent and responsive, updating in real time!

---

**Next Steps:**  
Begin simulation of **CORIâ€™s grippers** in **ROS 2 + Gazebo**, enabling physical pick-and-place testing using real-world laundry items such as:
- A red pair of shorts  
- A white sock  
- A black shirt  

These real-world inputs will be used to trigger matching digital actions in the Gazebo environment, sorting items into one of three virtual bins: **DARKS**, **LIGHTS**, or **COLORS**.

---

**Paused:**  
Moondream integration has been moved to the backlog in order to prioritize manipulation and binning logic.
