# CORI Update â€“ v1.1 (June 11, 2025)

Established a stable GUI overlay system for CORI's vision pipeline, including accurate bounding box drawing and frame categorization.

## Features Added

- **Real-time GUI with color-coded bounding boxes**
- **Validated performance at stable 30 FPS** in a blacked-out room
- **Accurate bounding box classification** for three categories:
  - LIGHTS
  - DARKS
  - COLORS
- **Spatially consistent visual overlays** that update in real time

## Next Steps

Begin simulation of **CORI's grippers** in **ROS 2 + Gazebo**, enabling physical pick-and-place testing using real-world laundry items:

- Red pair of shorts
- White sock
- Black shirt

These real-world inputs will trigger matching digital actions in the Gazebo environment, sorting items into three virtual bins: **DARKS**, **LIGHTS**, or **COLORS**.

## Development Status

**Paused:** Moondream integration has been moved to the backlog to prioritize manipulation and binning logic.
